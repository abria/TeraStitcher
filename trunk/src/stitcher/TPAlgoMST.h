		* Finds the optimal tile placement on the <volume> object member via Minimum Spanning Tree.
		* Stacks matrix is considered as a graph  where  displacements are edges a nd stacks are nodes. The inverse of
		* displacements reliability factors are  edge weights,  so that a totally unreliable displacement has a weight
		* 1/0.0 = +inf and a totally reliable displacement has a weight 1/1.0 = 1. Thus, weights will be in [1, +inf].
		* After computing the MST, the absolute tile positions are obtained from a stitchable source stack by means of
		* navigating the MST and using the selected displacements.
		* PROs: very general method; it ignores bad displacements since they have +inf weight.
		* CONs: the best path between two adjacent stacks can pass through many stacks even if the rejected displacem-
		*       ent is quite reliable, with a very little reliability gain.  This implies possible bad absolute  posi-
		*       tions estimations when the path is too long.
